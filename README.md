# Overview
A collection of book exercises and Kattis problems completed in C.

## K-R-C
*K-R-C* refers to the book: *"The C Programming Language 2nd Edition"* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

In the K-R-C directory I include sub directories per chapter of the book. Source files are named after exercises. 

## Kattis
[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) is a competitive programming website similar to Leetcode and CodeWars. 
The Kattis directory contains source files for all of the Kattis problems I have completed. Names in the Kattis directory 
are named similarly to the actual Kattis problems, just with English-keyboard-friendly characters.
